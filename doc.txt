### Anylzing Vanity through a Utilitarian Lens

One cannot analyze vanity without understanding its cause; vanity is an extension of one’s ego. Excessive ego causes excessive vanity. Therefore, the question of vanity is a question of ego.

Under utilitarianism, actions are good insofar as they maximize the happiness of the greatest number of people. Under this framework, we can look to empirical evidence to determine if ego is good or bad. 

Throughout History, many of the greatest leaders have been egotistical. Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Genghis Khan are all examples of egotistical leaders who have had a profound impact on the world. It is clear that these leaders had large egos because they all sought to conquer the world. In their conquests, these leaders killed millions of peoplea and caused a great deal of suffering. For Example, Genghis Khan's conquests killed over 11% of the world’s population. During Unimaginable atrocities, ego is never far. Utilitarian would suggest that ego is bad because it has the potential to cause suffering for a much larger number of people than the few it benefits.

In order to try to change the world, these leaders had to have a large ego. In their conquests, these leaders created products that have improved the lives of millions of people. For example, Steve Jobs created the iPhone, which has improved the lives of millions of people. Utilitarian would suggest that ego is good because it has the potential to benefit a much larger number of people than the few it harms.

In a corporate environment, the success of one person does not necessarily take away from the success of another. In fact, the success of one person can often lead to the success of another. For example, if a manager is successful, they are more likely to be promoted. This means that they will have more power to help others sucsed. Therefore, ego is good in this situation because it has the potential to benefit a much larger number of people than the few it harms. 

However, ego can also have negative effects for people more personally. For example, someone with a large ego is more likely to be arrogant and narcissistic. Not only do individuls with these traits tend to be disliked by others, but they also tend to have trouble forming meaningful relationships, which can lead to loneliness and depression. Ego can often get in the way of 
Therefore, it is clear that ego is neither good nor bad. Ego is a tool that can be used for good or evil. It is the actions of the peron that determine whether it is good or bad. So, vanity, an expression of ego, is neither good nor bad. Vanity is a tool that can be used for good or evil. It is the actions of person that determine whether it is good or bad.
